## WebExtension for Google Chrome / Firefox

This extension does two things, and nothing more :

1. automatically removes "skippable" video ads (those who display "5..4..3..2..1..Skip Ad"), <span style="color:red">without waiting for the 5 seconds timeout</span>.

2. automatically removes "overlayed" ads (those who display at the bottom of the video).

Unfortunately, I've yet to find a way to remove the "unskippable" video ads (those who display **"Video will play after ad"**) so you'll have to bear with those for the moment. I'll post a new major version of the extension if I manage to achieve it, but at least you're done with the "get up from the couch to skip a 3 minutes ad" annoyance when you're watching YT ðŸ¥³.

User experience has been extensively tested and is guaranteed to be comfortable. You may get 1 or 2 black frames when a skippable video ad appears, but nothing more.

Finally, the extension is completely free of any "buy me a beer", "buy me a coffee" or any similar demand for sponsoring. It just embarks the bare minimum to remove as many ads as possible from YT as of now. You using it is enough of a retribution for me.
