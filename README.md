## WebExtension for Google Chrome / Firefox

This extension does two things, and nothing more :

‚úÖ automatically removes "skippable" video ads (those who display "5..4..3..2..1..Skip Ad"), **without waiting for the 5 seconds timeout**.

‚úÖ automatically removes "overlayed" ads (those who display at the bottom of the video).

Unfortunately, I've yet to find a way to remove the "unskippable" video ads (those who display **"Video will play after ad"**) so you'll have to bear with those for the moment. I'll post a new major version of the extension if I manage to achieve it, but at least you're done with the "get up from the couch to skip a 3 minutes ad" annoyance when you're watching YT ü•≥.

This may constitute a viable alternative if you want a less ad-laden user experience on YT without resorting to a full blown adblocker (adblockers are too complex to configure properly, they break websites, yada yada yada ...).

User experience has been extensively tested and is guaranteed to be comfortable. You may get 1 or 2 black frames when a skippable video ad appears, but nothing more.

Finally, the extension is completely free of any "buy me a beer", "buy me a coffee" or any similar demand for sponsoring. It just embarks the bare minimum to remove as many ads as possible from YT as of now. You using it is enough of a retribution for me.
